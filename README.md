# Description

This repo is for projects I complete while completing the [Android Basics with Compose course by Google](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course). 

This is is a self-paced, online course on how to build Android apps using the latest best practices (August 2024). It covers the basics of building apps with Jetpack Compose, the recommended toolkit for building user interfaces on Android.
